O(M^2 * L^2)

Iterate through all members and compare each of the members groups to each other. If the members share a group_id then create a bidirectional edge between the two members and break from the loop which compares group_ids since only 1 edge may exist between two members.

IDDFS mimics the memory usage of DFS while obtaining the optimal solution by searching in a similar pattern to BFS. Therefore, the IDDFS uses substantially less memory, as the DFS only maintains the current path being traversed in memory and the BFS maintains a queue to store all the nodes at the current level. Therefore, DFS memory consumption is much smaller than BFS memory consumption.
BFS space complexity is O(|V|) compared to DFS space complexity of O(h) , where h is the maximal depth of the tree. 
IDDFS has the same space complexity as DFS.
